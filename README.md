<p>The BuckeyeVR project began at Ohio State University as an effort to develop smartphone based VR applications for math, physics and chemistry</p>

<p>In 2023, the source code is being released on github on the AGPL license for everyone to enjoy</p>

<p>The AGPL license means that you are free to copy and modify the code so long as you credit the BuckeyeVR project at Ohio State University as the origin of the source and so long as you share your modified version of the code with the authors. You can do this for example, by forking the code on github and leaving it as a public repository</p>

<p>Although you must acknowledge OSU and the BuckeyeVR team, you do not need to include the visuals that credit OSU in the apps. Please remove those if you decide to release something that is based on the BuckeyeVR source.</p>
  
<p>If you would like to submit a pull request to potentially improve the code base you are welcome to do that to. We will do our best to facilitate this, and we are open to giving others admin access to approve push requests if it seems like a good idea.</p>


  
<p>Enjoy!</p>

<p>The BuckeyeVR team</p>
